Kairos Policies 
========

Kairos (our home) is dedicated to providing harassment- and violence-free spaces for everyone, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, age, orientation, relationship status, power dynamics, or any other identity. These policies are created to outline expected and unacceptable behavior, as well as processes intended to support the creation of safe spaces and the protection of community members in those spaces.

* [Code of Conduct](citizen_code_of_conduct.md): A Code of Conduct for all attendees of Kairos  events.
* [Reporting Guidelines](reporting_guidelines.md): Guidelines for reporting violations of the Code of Conduct.
