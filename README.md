Kairos Policies 
========

Kairos is dedicated to being a harassment- and violence-free gathering space for every guest, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, age, orientation, relationship status, power dynamics, or any other identity. Harassment in any form is unacceptable. These policies are created to outline expected and unacceptable behavior, as well as processes intended to support the creation of safe space and the protection of our guests.
