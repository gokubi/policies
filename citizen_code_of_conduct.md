# Kairos Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

Kairos is dedicated to providing harassment- and violence-free spaces for everyone, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, age, orientation, relationship status, power dynamics, or any other identity. Harassment in any form is unacceptable. Our north star is a safe space, so violators will get booted from the gathering and not be invited to future gatherings.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in Kairos events, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite who participate at Kairos (and everywhere!) to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone, with particular focus on groups that have been historically discriminated against.

## 2. Consent

It is everyoneâ€™s responsibility to understand, ask for, and choose whether to give or withhold consent. Together, we seek to create a safe and consensual space where people are accepted and able to explore themselves and their relationships with others. Because of our country's long history of discrimination and violence against marginalized groups, we ask people with privilege to actively advocate for the safety and inclusion of people with less privilege.

These are the consent guidelines we expect everyone in Kairos to follow:

  * Practice enthusiastic consent: only an enthusiastic Yes is a Yes, everything else is a No.
  * No touching people or their personal property without consent.
  * Treat everyone as an equal by default. Everyone has responsibility to obtain, provide, or withhold consent regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, age, orientation, relationship status, power dynamics, or any other identity.
  * Negotiate the scope of your activities. We recommend making clear that all parties involved have given consent to any proposed interactions.
  * Each participant is responsible for making sure, to the best of their ability, that everyone involved has the physical, mental, and emotional capacity to give informed and voluntary consent during negotiation and during the activity itself.
  * Anyone can withdraw consent at any time during any activity. All participants shall endeavor to be clear and unequivocal when withdrawing consent.
  * All participants are responsible for stopping immediately any activity at the withdrawal of consent from anyone.
  * If your consent is violated, please get yourself safe and follow the [reporting guidelines](https://gokubi.github.io/policies/reporting_guidelines.html)
  * Our top priority is a safe space. Violation of the consent policy will lead to steps Kairos Organizers deem necesary to maintain saftey, including removing the perpetrator. Only after safety is ensured, other activties focused on personal and group healing and growth may take place. All events have people in place to handle violation of this policy and those procedures will be followed by all Kairos guests. No one is exempt from the policy.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all Kairos guests:

  * Adhere to the consent guidelines in section 2 above
  * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of our broader community.
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
  * Be an advocate for the health and safety of your fellow participants.
  * Speak up and act if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable at Kairos events:

  * Any non-consensual behavior--See section 2 above for more detail.
  * Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, particularly those related to sex, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, age, orientation, relationship status, power dynamics, or any other identity.
  * Photography or recording without the prior consent of all involved.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances. Without consent, none of these are acceptable.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Sustained disruption of Kairos events.

## 5. Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at Kairos events. Weapons include but are not limited to guns (even if not loaded), explosives, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Kairos guests are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any Kairos guest will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a Kairos guest engages in unacceptable behavior, Kairos Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from future Kairos events without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 7. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a Kairos Organizer as soon as possible. At a Kairos event, please get yourself safe and follow the [reporting guidelines](https://gokubi.github.io/policies/reporting_guidelines.html). Outside of an in-person event, please contact the Kairos Organizers listed in section 10. Please consider it your responsibilty to report unacceptable behavior as close to the time of occurrence as possible.
