# Kairos Community Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The Kairos Community is dedicated to providing harassment- and violence-free spaces for everyone, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, age, orientation, relationship status, power dynamics, or any other identity. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from an event and from the community at the discretion of the Karios Community Organizers.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in the Kairos Community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone, with particular focus on groups that have been historically discriminated against.

## 2. Consent

It is everyoneâ€™s responsibility to understand, ask for, and choose whether to give or withhold consent. Together, we seek to create a safe and consensual space where people are accepted and able to explore themselves and their relationships with others. Because of our country's long history of discrimination and violence against marginalized groups, we ask people with privilege to actively advocate for the safety and inclusion of people will less privilege.

These are the consent guidelines we expect everyone in the Kairos Community to follow:

  * No touching people or personal property without permission.
  * Treat everyone as an equal by default. Everyone has responsibility to obtain, provide, or withhold consent regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, age, orientation, relationship status, power dynamics, or any other identity.
  * Negotiate the scope of your activities. We recommend making clear that all parties involved have given consent to any proposed acts.
  * Each participant is responsible for making sure, to the best of their ability, that everyone involved has the physical, mental, and emotional capacity to give informed and voluntary consent during negotiation and during the activity itself.
  * Anyone can withdraw consent at any time during any activity. All participants shall endeavor to be clear and unequivocal when withdrawing consent.
  * All participants are responsible for stopping immediately any activity at the withdrawal of consent from anyone.
  * If your consent is violated or you experience a consent injury, please get yourself safe and follow the [reporting guidelines](https://gokubi.github.io/policies/reporting_guidelines.html)
  * Violation of the consent policy may result in expulsion from the event and/or temporary or permanent ban from Kairos Community events or activities. All events have people in place to handle violation of this policy and those procedures will be followed by all members of this community. No one is exempt from the policy.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

  * Adhere to the consent guidelines in section 2 above

  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
  * Be an advocate for the health and safety of your fellow participants.

Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any Kairos Community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a Kairos Community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the Kairos Community Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
