# Reporting Guidelines
These are guidelines for reporting violations of the [Kairos Code of Conduct](https://gokubi.github.io/policies/citizen_code_of_conduct.html).

## 1. Reporting In-Person at an Event

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you get yourself safe and report it immediately to the designated point of contact at the event.

The following will happen immediately after you report a violation:
 * You and the person violated (if not you) will be taken to a safe, quiet space on the premises.
 * The perpetrator of the violation will be escorted away from the event.
 * Details will be gathered to understand the circumstances of the violation.
 * The person violated will be supported in their decisions that will ensure immediate and short-term safety.
 * When the person violated chooses to leave the event, they will be offered an escort to their chosen local destination.
 
If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency services first.

**All reports will be kept confidential.** You will not be asked to take actions that make you feel unsafe. If there is a need for information to be shared (e.g., for the safety of others, or with law enforcement), this will be managed in consultation and collaboration with the reporters.
