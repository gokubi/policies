# Reporting Guidelines
These are guidelines for reporting violations of Kairos Community Code of Conduct.

## 1. Reporting In-Person at an Event

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you get yourself safe and report it immediately to the designated point of contact at the event.

The following will happen immediately after you report a violation:
 * You and the person violated (if not you) will be taken to a safe, quiet space on the premises.
 * The perpetrator of the violation will be escorted away from the event.
 * The person violated will be asked to decide what they want to happen next: do they want to leave the event, or do they want to stay?
 * The person violated will be supported in the decisions necessary around reporting the violation to the hosts, and potentially to other authorities
 * The person violated will be supported in thier decisions that will ensure immediate and short-term safety.
 * When the person violated chooses to leave the event, they will be escorted to their home, with care taken so that they do not cross paths with the perpetrator.
 
If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency services first. If you are unsure what service or agency is appropriate to contact, ask the Kairos Community Organizers or include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

## 2. Reporting via Email

If you cannot report a violation at the time and at the event at which it occurred, please report via email to Lesley Carmichael (<luxelife@gmail.com>) or Steve Andersen (<steve@gokubi.com>). In your report please include:

* Your contact info for follow-up contact.
* Names (legal, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
  * If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. 
  * If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency services first. If you are unsure what service or agency is appropriate to contact, ask the Kairos Community Organizers or include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

## 3. What happens after you file a report?

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases the Kairos Community Organizers may determine that a limited public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all persons violated and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

You will receive an email from the Kairos Community Organizaers acknowledging receipt as soon as possible, but within 24 hour.

The Kairos Community Organizers will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* What kind of response is appropriate.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the Kairos Community Organizers immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the Kairos Community Organizers have a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no code of conduct violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the Kairos Community Organizers to the individual(s) involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed suspension (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from events and online spaces).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Kairos Community spaces (events, meetings, mailing lists, etc.)
* A request to engage in mediation and/or an accountability plan.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but our response will be determined by what will be best for community safety.

The Kairos Community Organizers may choose to issue a public report of the incident or take additional actions.

## 4. Appealing the response

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the Kairos Community Organizers, contact the Community Organizers with your appeal and they will review the case.
