# Reporting Guidelines
These are guidelines for reporting violations of Kairos Code of Conduct.

## 1. Reporting In-Person at an Event

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you get yourself safe and report it immediately to the designated point of contact at the event.

The following will happen immediately after you report a violation:
 * You and the person violated (if not you) will be taken to a safe, quiet space on the premises.
 * The perpetrator of the violation will be escorted away from the event.
 * Details will be gathered for understanding of the violation.
 * The person violated will be supported in thier decisions that will ensure immediate and short-term safety.
 * When the person violated chooses to leave the event, they will be offered an escort to their chosen local destination.
 
If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate emergency services first. If you are unsure what service or agency is appropriate to contact, ask Kairos Organizers or include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

**All reports will be kept confidential.** In some cases Kairos Organizers may determine that a limited public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all persons violated and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
